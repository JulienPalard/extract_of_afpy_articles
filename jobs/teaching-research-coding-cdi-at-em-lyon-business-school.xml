We are seeking talented, motivated teachers who can explain coding to non-engineers, and help with data analytic research. Our primary goal is to find good, empathetic teachers! Candidates with experience using Excel, SQL, and doing business data analytics are especially welcome. We are hiring for multiple positions at different data analytic skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;
