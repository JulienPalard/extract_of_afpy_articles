(Our current setup is mostly based on Python).

Must have:

- very solid skills in either Python or Ruby (or outstanding skills in Java, C++ or Brainfuck)
- taste for modular solutions and short development cycles
- robust practice of TDD and continuous integration, or the strong desire to learn them
- self-motivation, and the ability to work in informal and relaxed environments
- intellectual curiosity

Nice to have (but far from indispensable):

- experience in effectively playing with big data
- experience in data visualization
- some knowledge and experience with AWS
- some knowledge of either Haskell, Clojure or OCaml

We are looking for both experienced and more junior profiles.</summary><content type="html"></content><company>tinyclues</company><address>4 boulevard de Strasbourg
