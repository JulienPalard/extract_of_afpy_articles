You will manage and build a team of 4 and work side by side with our Ops, Hosting, Network and developers team to provide the next generation of asset management and provisioning tool.
Through this unique component we want to provide a portal and an API to manage all our servers. 
Offer cutting-edge infrastructure services to internal customers : on-demand resource allocation, automatic configuration, self-registration to service discovery and inventory. Either by developing specifics functionality, or integrating open sources technologies ( puppet, chef, capistrano, nagios, centreon, altiris, cobbler, Hadoop, backuppc  ). Bring a functional and structured approach to meet compliance rules for public companies and to ensure reliability and robustness.
 
Develop open source projects. Because we are working at the forefront of technology, we are dealing with problems that few have faced. We’re big users of open source, and we’d like to give back to the community.</summary><content type="html"></content><company>Criteo</company><address></address><contact>Vincent Landrieux</contact><location></location><phone></phone><link href="http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?k=Job&amp;c=qRZ9VfwE&amp;j=oS1OZfwq" rel="via"></link></entry>
