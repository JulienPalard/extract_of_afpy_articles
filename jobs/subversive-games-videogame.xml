I'm french but started a video games company called www.subversivegames.com in australia and applicants would need to be able to work in english. I'm currently opening the european office in paris but we have a great lead dev  in perth, australia that needs some help to finalise a game. So there is an urgent need for a mid to high experienced python coder ; first to finalise our game  (mostly interface connecting with game engine) but also to help us in the  longer term on a new project to be started asap. the job can be based from home working remotely but for the right person, and if interested, we might offer a position in australia, which trust me is an amazing place:)
we are small and creative o you can make a big difference and maybe grow with us!
