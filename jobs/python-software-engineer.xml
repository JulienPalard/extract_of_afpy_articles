You will be part of a team of 4 and work side by side with our Ops, Hosting, dev teams to design and build the next generation of asset management and provisioning tools. Through this unique component we want to provide a portal and an API to manage all our servers. 

Offer cutting-edge infrastructure services to internal customers : on-demand resource allocation, automatic configuration, self-registration to service discovery and inventory. Either by developing specifics functionality, or integrating open sources technologies ( puppet, chef, capistrano, nagios, centreon, altiris, cobbler, Hadoop, backuppc  ). 

 Develop open source projects. Because we are working at the forefront of technology, we are dealing with problems that few have faced. We’re big users of open source, and we’d like to give back to the community.
