The course is taught as partly online (with assigned reading and exercises) and partly in help sessions. Structured lecture is not required. The course uses Jupyter Notebooks. (The material is already prepared but alternate content that covers the same ground could be acceptable.) The course introduces students to the most important basic elements in Python. There may be as many as 100 students in this course so the grading is the most difficult part. If this period works for a visiting professor or data science practitioner who would like to visit Lyon, we can also collaborate on research/workshops and remunerate accordingly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October-Dec 2017, 8 weeks, Python Data Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This course follows after the Bootcamp, and meets once a week (3 hours) for 8 weeks from October to early December. There is weekly homework. It teaches pandas, reading data in and out from files, cleaning data, using API calls, time series, SQL access, etc. This course is also taught with Jupyter notebooks. (Half of this material is prepared; alternate content could also be substituted if it meets the course needs.) This course should have a maximum of 25 students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of these courses meet once per week, so a remote person who travels once a week would work fine too (we will pay transportation).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><company>emlyon business school</company><address>23 ave Guy de Collongue
